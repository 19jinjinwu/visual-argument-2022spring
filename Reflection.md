## Photoshop vs. Gimp

The reason why I chose Photoshop over gimp was because Photoshop has a wide variety of healing tools. Since I was going to manipulate the background with the pole, it was highly necessary to make the background appear as if it was never tampered with. I used the patch content tool and the spot healing tool to do this, and also ended up removing some birds because I found them a bit distracting. The object select tool is also super useful to select and cut out edges, and I could modify the selection with the quick selection brush (+ vs. - content). One other feature was being able to adjust the strength of tools, such as the blur and the eraser tool. 

## Description

For my visual argument, I criticized food waste in America (specifically towards priviledged people). In the center and the main graphical element is a pizza slice, which is a combination of 2 images that I blended using the eraser tool and the liquify tool. The positioning and saturation captures the perfectly edible and enticing food, that is going to waste. The cheese pull fades into the trash in the background, which I blended using a brush and a clipping mask to the layer. I also manipulated the sky in the background to be more dark/gloomy, by adding an adjustment layer and decreasing the brightness and increasing contrast. Furthermore, I removed the light pole in the background by using the patch tool and selecting a different part of the sky, while blending the sharp, unnatural edges with the spot healing brush. The text is in a bold font to emphasize the seriousness of the topic, with areas of red color to highlight the important statistics. The logos depict ways that we, as humans, can reduce food waste and help others in need. The bottom caption is arched because it creates movement leading to the 3 ways to help, and because it fits more evenly over the various logos (the "mindful" logo is slightly bigger because it is the most efficient solution). Likewise, I painted a black bar over the background, clipping it and using the gaussian blur feature to create a gradient for the logos to stand out. Lastly, the pizza casts a shadow (w/ "soft light" layer blend mode, fill layer, and gaussian blur) over the trash to accurately display physics, and the captions have a drop shadow to make it pop against the flat background.

Both of these feedback reviews mentioned that the pole in the background was distracting, which I also thought about after finishing my first draft. I made a note to myself to remove it from the image even prior to the feedback reviews, but I wasn't sure exactly how to. Luckily, in the week after the draft was due, we learned some Photoshopping techniques in my Photography class. While I'm experienced in drawing in Photoshop, I never manipulated a photo. We used the patch and context-aware tool during the class, which was really helpful for this project to remove the pole from the background seamlessly. Another suggestion was adding a shadow in the background of the pizza. I did try this out but it looked a bit funky because I wanted the pizza to appear as a hovering object, not a pasted image. Instead, I took this inspiration and added a drop shadow on the trash itself to emphasize the realistic-ness of this _surrealistic_ piece.

## Criteria
As for meeting the baseline criteria of this project, I believe I have met all of them. I paid careful attention to the arrangement, size, color, constrast, and rhythm in my composition to guide a viewer's attention, including the font choice. I made a clear argument with both the text and the graphics. I used more than 3 layers, multiple tools, while also crediting the creators and making meaningful commit messages. 

For aspirational inspirations, I was able to effectively organize my files in Photoshop. Many of my layers overlapped, and I used tools that I was unfamiliar with prior to this project, such as adjustment masks, fill masks, and the patch tool. I was able to change the message of an appetizing pizza, by depicting it being pulled out from a landfill of trash. According to multiple feedbacks, the message was clear and understandable. I also made use of a bold font and color to draw the eye to the important parts of the text.
