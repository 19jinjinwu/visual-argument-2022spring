For this draft, I darkened the color of the gradual transition from the pizza to the landfill. I added the text using Bebas Neue font for the titles, which makes a very bold and serious statement. I used black at the top and white at the bottom to create contrast against the background. To bring clarity to the bottom text, I added a black gradient at the bottom of the background. I emphasized the important numbers in the statistics/text in an reddish orange so that it would match the pepperoni on the pizza. When putting on the logos, they felt boring so I wanted to create movement with the arch of the text, which corresponded to the position of the logos. I increased the mindfulness logo because that is the most effective method of solving the problem of food waste. For the captions of the logos, I used a font called Antonio because it complimented the boldness of the titles. It was also slightly compacted, which fit neatly under the logos. My next steps are to make the top title more visible. The light pole interferes with the words, so I will try to photoshop it out and possibly add a shadow to the text. I also feel like the cheese pull transition to the landfill is unnatural, so I might add some splotches of light gray and dark gray to blend better. Or I will use an eraser to gradually remove the cheese pull. Lastly, I still need to determine if I should add the steam effect and molding spots to the pizza.
