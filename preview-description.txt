I decided to change my idea from my proposal and do a pizza being pulled from landfill instead. I found a nice slice of cheesy pizza that was being stretched and thought it would fit well in the dull, gray trashy background. The pizza is actually a combination of 3 pizza images because one had a clear cheese pull, one looked more appetizing on the actual slice, and the last one had a nice steam coming off of it. I used the liquify feature to merge the pizza slice and cheese pull because blurring or smudging it would make the pizza lose detail in texture. I wanted to incorporate the steam with a layer effect, but I also might just create it myself using one of the Photoshop rendering effects if it does not blend nicely. I'm debating whether I want to give the pizza a rotten look to indicate the waste of food, but at the same time, I like the contrast between the "perfectly good food" and the ugly landfill. My next steps are to add the text, the smoke, and add the logos.
