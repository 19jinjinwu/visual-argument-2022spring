I decided to change my idea from my propossal and do a pizza being pulled from landfill instead. I found a nice slice of cheesy pizza that was being stretched and thought it would fit well in the dull, gray trashy background. The pizza is actually a combination of 2 images because one had a more clear cheese pull, while the other one looked nicer on the actual slice. I used the liquify feature to merge the images because blurring or smudging it would make the pizza lose detail in texture. I want to incorporate the steam that was from one of the original pizza photos (with layer effect), but I also might just create it myself using one of the Photoshop rendering effects. I'm debating whether I want to give the pizza a rotten look to indicate the waste of food, but I like the contrast between the "perfectly good food" and the ugly landfill. My next steps are to add the text, the smoke, and add the logos.
